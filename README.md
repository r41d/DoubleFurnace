# DoubleFurnace
Factorio Mod which adds a double furnace to the game, both a variant for steel and electric.

A double furnace looks similar to an steel/electric furnace (but it's green)
and it can smelt iron ore directly to steel (but can't smelt anything else).

# Installation from Factorio Mod Portal
Please go to https://mods.factorio.com/mod/DoubleFurnace or download it ingame.

Not recommended, but if you want to do it, download the zip from GitHub and unzip it in your Factorio mods folder.
The unpacked folder will most likely have the name "DoubleFurnace-master".
You need to rename it to "DoubleFurnace_#CurrentVersion" where CurrentVersion needs to be replaced by the version found in info.json
