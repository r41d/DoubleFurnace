# DoubleFurnace
Factorio Mod which adds a double furnace to the game, both a variant for steel and electric.

A double furnace looks similar to an steel/electric furnace (but it's green)
and it can smelt iron ore directly to steel (but can't smelt anything else).

# Installation from Factorio Mod Portal

You need to rename it to "DoubleFurnace_#CurrentVersion" where CurrentVersion needs to be replaced by the version found in info.json
